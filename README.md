# Collaboration on WMI
The goal of this organization is to bring together WMI researchers and make it easier to use, compare with and develop WMI solvers.
We offer a framework and library called pywmi that offers modeling languages WMI problems, a common internal format for WMI problems, interfaces for solvers, tools for WMI developers, implementations of state-of-the-art solvers, a command line interface to compute query probabilities and more.
